# Easy splines in Matlab

This code can be used to draw cubic splines in Matlab by only entering the points through which the spline should pass.
Control points are calculated automatically using the algorithm of Hobby (1986), which allows a slope and "tension" of the spline to be specified instead.

See the inline help in the .m file for usage information.
